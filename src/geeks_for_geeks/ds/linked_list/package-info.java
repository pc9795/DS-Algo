/*
 * Disadvantages of Arrays:
 * ------------------------
 * 1. Size of arrays is fixed. So we must know the upper limit on number of elements in advance. -> Dynamic Size
 * 2. Inserting an element in the array is expensive. -> Ease of insertion/deletion
 *
 * Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
 * ------------------------------
 * 1. Random access is not allowed.
 * 2. Extra memory space for pointers.
 * 3. Not cache friendly
 *
 * Merge sort in doubly linked list is same as Linked List; only prev pointers have to be updated.
 *
 * Circular linked list can be used in place of queue. We can maintain a pointer to the last
 * inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.
