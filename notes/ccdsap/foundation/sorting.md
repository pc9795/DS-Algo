If array is in ascending order and we choose pivot as first element.

           n
          / \
         1  n-1
            / \
           1  n-2

worst case n^2 in quick sort; partition is resulting in a skewed tree.

If user first sorts the column in the spreadsheet in wrong order(ascending or descending) , realizes the mistake and 
then repeats the sort in the opposite direction. If the column sorting algorithm is quick sort, the second sort provides
 a worst case input.
