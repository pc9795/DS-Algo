Backtracking problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once.
A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a configuration that follows given problem 
constraints. Backtracking works in incremental way and is an optimization over the naive solution where all possible 
configurations are generated and tried.
